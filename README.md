## Dustfall Macroquad Prototype

This crate is a playground for rendering an isometric grid using the lightweight `macroquad` game library.

### Run

```bash
cargo run
```

That launches a window with a pseudo-random textured plane to validate rendering and camera math. Close the window or press `Esc` to exit.

### Controls

- Mouse left/right drag – pan the camera
- Touch or trackpad two-finger drag (scroll gesture) – pan the camera
